    "content": "Threat Dragon is a free, open-source, cross-platform threat modeling application including system diagramming and a rule engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. Threat Dragon supports STRIDE1, LINDUN2 and CIA3. It is an OWASP Incubator Project and follows the values and principles of the threat modeling manifesto. The roadmap for the project is a great UX, a powerful rule engine and integration with other development lifecycle tools. There is a good overview of threat modeling and risk assessment from OWASP, and this expands on what the Threat Dragon project aims for: . | designing the data flow diagram | automatic determining and ranking threats | suggested mitigations | entry of mitigations and counter measures | . The application comes in two variants: . | A desktop application: This is based on Electron, with model files stored on the local filesystem. There are installers available for both Windows and Mac OSX, as well as rpm and debian packages for Linux. | A web application: For the web application model files are stored in GitHub, with other storage methods to follow. | . 1: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, DoS, Elevation of privilege 2: Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, Non-compliance 3: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability .

To build and run locally follow these steps: . Install git and node.js - which includes the node package manager npm. To get the code, navigate to where you want your code to be located and do . git init . git clone https://github.com/owasp/threat-dragon.git . This installs code in two sub-folders. One for the main application (td) and one for the unit tests (td.tests). To install, do: . npm install . Environment variables . Threat Dragon uses GitHub to store threat models, so you need to go to your GitHub account and register it as a GitHub application. Once you have done that you need to set the Client ID and Client Secret as environment variables (GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET). You also need to set a session signing key environment variable (SESSION_SIGNING_KEY). Setting up these environment variables has caused some confusion in the past, so there is a step-by-step guide to this. Once a user is signed in, their session information contains an OAuth access token with write access to their GitHub repos. For security, this is encrypted before storage in the session. The session encryption supports multiple keys so that they can be expired without any interruption to the running application. The primary key is always used for encryption. Retired keys can be kept available for decrypting existing sessions. Once all sessions are using the new primary key (typically this will be around 60 minutes maximum), the old one can be safely removed. The keys are stored as a JSON string in the SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEYS environment variable. For example: . [{\\\"isPrimary\\\": true, \\\"id\\\": 0, \\\"value\\\": \\\"abcdef\\\"}, {\\\"isPrimary\\\": false, \\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"value\\\": \\\"ghijkl\\\"}] . If you are developing locally, you can choose to store the session data in memory using the express-session in-memory store. To do this the SESSION_STOREenvironment variale to local. As mentioned in the express-session docs this is for development only - it is not suitable for production. To remind you of this, Threat Dragon will write a log message at severity ERROR when it starts if the in memory session store is used. For production use, Threat Dragon currently supports Azure Table Storage for the session store via connect-azuretables. To make this store work you need to specify an Azure Storage Account and key as environment variables AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT and AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY. See the connect-azuretables documentation for more options. If you want to use an alternative session store in production, install it and edit the session.config.js file. Lastly, by default, Threat Dragon will set the secure flag on cookies. To override this for development purposes, set the NODE_ENV environment variable to development. Running the application . Once your environment variables are set up, start the node web server: . npm start . If you then browse to http://localhost:3000 you should see the running application. ",
